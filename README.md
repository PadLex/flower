##Documentation

Flower allows you to compile a flowchart to a javascript file.
The generated file can then be accessed by other scripts in your project which in turn, must pass any methods or variables you call from in the flowchart.

* ###Editor
Currently the only supported editor is *[draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), a popular open source flowchart editor.

*_a specially designed fork of which, will come soon._
